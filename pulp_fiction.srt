1
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,534
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,070
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,072
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,642
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,112
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,281
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,516
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,619
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:56,156
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,726
Since I'm never gonna
do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:04,531
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,434
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

13
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,805
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,975
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,845
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,980
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,083
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,387
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,924
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,961
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,598
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,467
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:46,373
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,078
- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,848
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,918
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,954
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,457
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:07,694
-No more liquor stores?
-What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,731
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,733
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,169
You tell'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,171
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,475
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,846
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,848
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,551
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:35,055
You got Grandpa Irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,057
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,059
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,062
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,164
- Not in this life.
- What then?

43
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,535
Garçon, coffee!

44
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,904
This place.

45
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,475
Garçon means boy.

46
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,381
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,418
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:08,155
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,558
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,362
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:19,099
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,870
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,441
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.

54
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,777
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,213
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,116
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:40,153
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,156
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,759
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,929
Customers sittin' there
with food in their mouths,
they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:53,667
One minute, they're havin'
a Denver omelet, the next, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:58,805
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,575
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,479
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:08,949
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

66
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,318
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:15,055
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,157
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,728
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:26,300
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time, remember?

71
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,136
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,477
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,181
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

74
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,151
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:48,121
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,422
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:27,000

*** by Terrok ***

78
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,835
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Get down with the boogie

79
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,071
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Get it on

80
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,340
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Get down with the boogie

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,642
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Get it on

82
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,978
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Get up with the boogie

83
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,113
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Get up with the get down

84
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,482
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Get down and boogie

85
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,719
-  Jungle boogie 
-  Shake it around

86
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:09,596
- Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

87
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,499
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

88
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:17,204
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

89
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,607
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

90
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,343
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

91
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,746
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

92
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,016
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

93
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:33,487
It's illegal to carry it,
but-but that doesn't matter,
'cause get a load of this.

94
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:38,025
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam, it's illegal
for them to search you.

95
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:42,029
- I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.
- Oh, man! I'm goin'.

96
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,631
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

97
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,634
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

98
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,437
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?
- What?

99
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:54,441
It's the little differences.
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here,

100
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:58,078
- but it's just there,
it's a little different.
- Example.

101
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,281
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

102
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,985
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

103
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,889
And in Paris, you can buy
a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call...

104
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,459
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

105
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,728
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

106
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,598
They got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

107
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,568
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

108
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,103
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

109
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,105
What do they call a Big Mac?

110
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,475
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

111
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,678
Le Big Mac.

112
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:35,916
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't
go into Burger King.

113
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:39,419
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?
- What?

114
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,489
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

115
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:46,860
- I seen'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown'em in that shit.
- Yuck.

116
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,833
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

117
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,572
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

118
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,242
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

119
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,712
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?
- It's possible.

120
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,148
We should have
fuckin' shotguns.

121
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,884
- What's her name?
- Mia.

122
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:15,155
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

123
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,825
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

124
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,395
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

125
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:25,899
- I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?

126
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,503
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

127
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,207
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

128
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,376
- and on this invention
they show shows, right?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,848
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

130
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,851
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

131
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,854
and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if
they wanna make more shows.

132
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,458
Some get chosen and
become television programs.
Some don't, become nothin'.

133
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,728
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

134
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,564
You remember
Antwan Rockamora?

135
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:01,468
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

136
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,938
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.

137
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,841
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

138
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:12,346
- I think I know who you mean.
What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

139
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,650
Word 'round the campfire is
it was on account of
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

140
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,829
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

141
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:32,599
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

142
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,104
A foot massage?

143
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,239
- That's it?

144
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,241
Then what'd Marsellus do?

145
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,478
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

146
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:48,482
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

147
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:52,619
He had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

148
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,955
Nigger fell through that.

149
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,958
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

150
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,162
- That's a damn shame.

151
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,671
- But still, you play
with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean?

152
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:14,908
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

153
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,444
You don't think he overreacted?

154
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:22,382
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

155
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:26,620
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.

156
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,224
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

157
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,195
I mean, is it as bad as eatin'
her pussy out? No, but it's
the same fuckin' ballpark.

158
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,364
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

159
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,033
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

160
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,037
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

161
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,040
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

162
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,878
But touchin' his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies...

163
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:55,215
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

164
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:59,152
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

165
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,322
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

166
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,058
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

167
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,363
Shit, yeah!
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

168
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,099
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

169
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,203
- Fuck you.

170
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,373
- You give'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

171
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,709
- You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.

172
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,979
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

173
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,616
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

174
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:35,022
What time you got?

175
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,224
7:22 in the a.m.

176
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,861
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

177
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,206
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

178
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,475
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin' house,

179
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,278
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

180
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:02,583
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass,
'cause I kill the motherfucker.

181
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,621
I ain't sayin' it's right,
but you sayin' a massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

182
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:12,326
Now, look, I've given a million
ladies a million foot massages,
and they all meant somethin'.

183
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:16,129
We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's
so fuckin' cool about them.

184
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,298
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

185
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,602
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

186
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:26,740
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

187
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:31,211
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

188
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,081
You know what I'm sayin'?

189
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,083
It's an interestin' point.

190
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,085
Come on.
Let's get into character.

191
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,027
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

192
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:50,130
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

193
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:55,435
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

194
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,473
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

195
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,910
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

196
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,512
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

197
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,215
It is not a date.

198
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:12,386
It's just like if you were
gonna take your buddy's wife
to a movie or somethin'.

199
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,989
- It's just good company, that's all.

200
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:24,765
- It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

201
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,975
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

202
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,711
Hey, keep chillin'.

203
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,687
You know who we are?

204
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:50,724
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

205
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,827
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

206
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,466
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

207
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,538
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

208
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,942
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

209
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,844
don't ya, Brett?

210
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,579
Yeah, I remember.

211
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:16,984
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

212
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,686
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

213
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,722
Hamburgers.

214
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,893
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

215
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,563
What kind of hamburgers?

216
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,365
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

217
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,535
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?

218
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,404
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

219
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,607
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

220
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:44,611
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

221
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,381
They're... They're good.

222
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,083
You mind if I try
one of yours?

223
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,586
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

224
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,899
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

225
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,502
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

226
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:12,039
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

227
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,542
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

228
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:19,446
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

229
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:22,649
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

230
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,886
But I do love the taste
of a good burger.

231
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:30,490
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

232
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,626
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

233
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:36,730
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

234
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:40,267
You know why they call it that?

235
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,403
Uh, because of
the metric system?

236
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,774
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

237
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,178
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

238
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,649
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

239
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:57,651
Sprite. Good.

240
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:01,588
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

241
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,525
Go right ahead.

242
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,805
That hit the spot.

243
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,943
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

244
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,547
- Why don't you tell my man
Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- It's over...

245
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:30,217
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

246
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,722
You were sayin'?

247
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,858
It's in the cupboard.

248
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:43,597
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.

249
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,787
We happy?

250
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:09,723
Vincent?

251
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,492
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

252
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:18,866
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l...
I didn't get your name.

253
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,135
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

254
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:27,541
- My name's Pitt, and your ass
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No, no, no.

255
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,945
I just want you
to know how...

256
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:38,085
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

257
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,354
with us and Mr. Wallace.

258
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,925
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never...

259
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:48,395
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

260
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,064
- I didn't mean to do that. Please.

261
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:56,303
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

262
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,608
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

263
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,411
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

264
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,951
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

265
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,220
What?

266
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:16,557
- What country you from?
- What?

267
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,894
- "What" ain't no country I ever
heard of. They speak English in What?
- W-What?

268
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,664
- English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?
- Yes!

269
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,432
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

270
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,936
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

271
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,638
- What? l...
- Say "what" again!

272
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:35,642
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

273
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:39,613
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.

274
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,015
- Go on!
- He's bald!

275
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,818
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

276
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:50,591
Does he look... like a bitch?

277
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,894
- No!
- Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch?

278
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:57,598
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

279
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,833
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

280
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,172
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

281
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:08,308
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

282
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,946
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.

283
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,349
Ezekiel 25:17.

284
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,719
"The path of the righteous man...

285
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:22,723
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

286
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,726
and the tyranny of evil men.

287
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:30,731
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

288
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,967
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

289
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,703
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

290
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,340
and the finder
of lost children.

291
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,211
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

292
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,246
and furious anger...

293
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:50,984
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!

294
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:54,888
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

295
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,358
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

296
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:19,246
I think you gonna find...

297
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,982
when all this shit
is over and done...

298
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,021
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

299
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,392
The thing is, Butch,

300
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,495
right now...
you got ability.

301
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,600
But painful as it may be,

302
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,836
ability... don't last.

303
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:48,909
And your days are just about over.

304
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:53,380
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

305
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:58,485
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

306
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:05,859
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

307
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:09,897
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

308
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:15,335
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

309
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,841
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

310
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,478
Besides, Butch,

311
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:29,850
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

312
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,154
Two?

313
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:38,659
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

314
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,764
You came close,
but you never made it.

315
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,035
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

316
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,020
You my nigger?

317
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:14,094
Certainly appears so.

318
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:24,471
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

319
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,978
That's pride fuckin' with you.

320
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,648
Fuck pride!

321
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:39,419
Pride only hurts.

322
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:41,421
It never helps.

323
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,892
You fight through that shit.

324
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:51,298
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

325
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:56,303
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

326
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:02,543
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

327
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,413
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

328
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:12,419
Say it.

329
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:18,125
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.

330
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,596
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

331
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:27,134
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

332
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:31,038
- Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.

333
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:34,374
Where's the big man?

334
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,377
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

335
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:41,915
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

336
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:46,887
How ya been?

337
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:50,891
- I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?
- All right.

338
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,362
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

339
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,701
At Marsellus's request.

340
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,538
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

341
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:07,808
- What's so fuckin' funny?

342
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,477
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

343
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:14,815
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

344
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:17,551
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

345
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,586
Laugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

346
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:22,789
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

347
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,926
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

348
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,495
Asshole.

349
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:36,937
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

350
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,939
No.

351
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:45,679
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

352
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:51,285
-What was that?
-I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

353
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:53,954
Vincent Vega's in the house?

354
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:57,324
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

355
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,701
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

356
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:09,937
You shouldn't worry about it.

357
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,973
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

358
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,811
And some matches.

359
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,850
Thanks.

360
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:29,056
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

361
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:33,026
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

362
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:37,497
That gun to pierce your ears,
they don't use that to pierce
your nipples, do they?

363
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:41,435
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

364
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:46,373
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

365
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,943
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

366
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,146
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

367
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:56,083
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

368
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:59,620
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

369
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,622
I was just curious,

370
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:05,559
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

371
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:09,129
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

372
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:13,166
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

373
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,010
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

374
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:26,513
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

375
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,516
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

376
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:34,021
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

377
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:37,057
But this one
is a little more expensive.

378
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:39,526
This is 500 a gram.

379
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:42,996
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

380
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:47,167
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

381
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:50,904
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

382
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,740
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

383
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:56,844
Am I a nigger?
Are we in Inglewood? No.

384
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,080
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

385
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:03,150
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

386
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,587
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

387
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,957
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

388
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,894
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

389
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:17,965
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

390
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:21,902
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

391
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,640
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

392
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:30,143
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

393
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,980
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

394
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:37,251
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

395
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,487
That is what a nice guy I am.

396
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:44,658
- I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

397
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,727
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

398
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:51,732
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

399
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,767
Okay.

400
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:57,371
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

401
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:00,741
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

402
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:04,978
-The one with all the shit in her face?
-No, that's Jody.

403
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:07,481
That's my wife.

404
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:12,152
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

405
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:16,089
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

406
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,892
- I'll take a rain check.

407
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:22,296
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.

408
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:25,666
Still got your Malibu?

409
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:28,836
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

410
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:30,838
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

411
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:34,508
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

412
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:37,277
I had it in storage
for three years.

413
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:41,682
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

414
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:46,186
They should be fuckin' killed,
man. No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

415
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:50,991
I wish I could've caught him
doin' it. I'd have given
anything to catch that asshole.

416
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:55,796
- It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.
- What a fucker!

417
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:58,665
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

418
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:01,635
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

419
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:04,104
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

420
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:06,340
Thank you.

421
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:09,209
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

422
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:12,579
Muchas gracias.

423
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:59,620
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

424
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:03,891
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

425
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,768
Hello?

426
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:19,339
Billy Raye was a preacher's son
and when his daddy would visit
he'd come along

427
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,542
Vincent.

428
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,113
Vincent.

429
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,115
I'm on the intercom.

430
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,817
Where is...
Where is the intercom?

431
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:34,221
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

432
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,390
To your right.

433
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,628
Warm.

434
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,797
Warmer.

435
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:45,866
Disco.

436
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,535
Hello?

437
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:51,939
Push the button
if you want to talk.

438
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,074
Hello?

439
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:57,978
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

440
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:01,448
The bar's by the fireplace.

441
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,385
Okay.

442
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,888
When he started
sweet talkin' to me

443
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:10,724
He come and tell me
everything is all right

444
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,460
He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right

445
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:15,462
Can I get away
again tonight

446
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,131
The only one who could
ever reach me

447
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:20,834
Was the son
of a preacher man

448
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,971
The only boy
who could ever teach me

449
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:27,007
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

450
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:29,376
He was

451
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:32,079
- Lord he knows he was
- Yes he was

452
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,150
How will I remember

453
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,953
The look was in his eyes

454
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,523
Stealing kisses from me
on the sly

455
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:45,192
Taking time to make time

456
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,761
Telling me that
he's all mine

457
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:50,764
- Learning from each other's knowin'

458
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:52,933
Looking to see
how much we've grown

459
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,469
And the only one
who could ever reach me

460
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,804
Was the son
of a preacher man

461
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,841
The only boy
who could ever teach me

462
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:03,277
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

463
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:06,146
- Was, was
- He was

464
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,916
- Oh, yes he was

465
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:10,817
Let's go.

466
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:18,425
What the fuck is this place?

467
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:21,995
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

468
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,398
- An Elvis man should love it.

469
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:28,669
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

470
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,538
Don't be a...

471
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:35,042
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

472
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:58,265
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

473
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:01,168
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

474
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:04,137
- We reserved a car.

475
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:09,743
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat'em
over there in the Chrysler.

476
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,180
School get out, baby
Gonna tell you some news

477
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:15,415
Sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes

478
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:20,254
One, two, buckle the shoes
Three, four, get out on the floor

479
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,626
Five, six, come get your kicks down at
the corner of Lincoln and 46th, yeah

480
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,164
All right

481
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:36,003
I've been waitin' in school
all day long

482
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:38,172
Waiting on the bell to ring
so I can go home

483
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:40,741
Throw my books on the table
Pick up the telephone

484
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,910
- Come on, baby
- Coffee, please? Decaf.

485
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,279
- Just a minute.
- Heading down to the drugstore
to get a soda pop

486
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:47,714
Throw a nickel in the jukebox
Then we start to rock

487
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,850
School's out, baby
Gonna tell you some news

488
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,985
You sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes

489
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:54,721
Well, it's one, two
Buckle the shoes

490
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:57,124
Three, four
Get out on the floor

491
00:35:57,191 --> 00:36:01,094
Five, six, come get your kicks
down at the corner of Lincoln and 46th

492
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:08,936
Gonna rock all night
Just wait and see

493
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:12,739
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

494
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,444
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

495
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,914
- Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.
- Vincent!

496
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:28,188
Just to let you
all know, Ricky will be back
in the second half of our show,

497
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:32,826
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

498
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:35,262
Thank you.

499
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:38,799
Call for...

500
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:43,470
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think?

501
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:48,242
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

502
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:52,145
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

503
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:59,019
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,
yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

504
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:01,889
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked?

505
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:05,259
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
- Bloody as hell, and...

506
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:08,061
Oh, yeah, look at this...
vanilla Coke.

507
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,097
What about you, Peggy Sue?

508
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:13,500
I'll have the...

509
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:17,905
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

510
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:21,875
And... a five-dollar shake.

511
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:24,678
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

512
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:28,882
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order
a five-dollar shake?

513
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,018
Mm-hmm.

514
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,254
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?

515
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:38,725
- Last I heard.
- That's five dollars? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin'?

516
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:41,161
- No.
- Just checking.

517
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:43,931
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

518
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:45,933
To Lonesome Town

519
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:49,970
To cry my troubles away

520
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:55,642
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy?

521
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,579
You can have this one, cowgirl.

522
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:00,581
- Thanks.

523
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:03,050
The streets are filled
with regret

524
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:07,354
Think nothin' of it.

525
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:11,258
Lay me down
in Lonesome Town

526
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:14,862
- I can learn to forget
- So...

527
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:18,031
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

528
00:38:18,098 --> 00:38:21,235
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

529
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,837
Just over three years.

530
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:29,209
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

531
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:33,013
No kiddin'?
I didn't know that.

532
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,016
Why would you?

533
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,623
I heard you did a pilot.

534
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:47,594
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?

535
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:52,366
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

536
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:55,169
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

537
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:57,504
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

538
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:00,040
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

539
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,876
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

540
00:39:02,943 --> 00:39:06,647
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

541
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:09,850
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

542
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:13,987
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

543
00:39:14,054 --> 00:39:16,924
French fox's speciality was sex.

544
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,361
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.

545
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,463
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,

546
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,401
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

547
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:31,738
According to the show,
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.

548
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:34,575
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

549
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:38,779
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

550
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:42,149
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

551
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:46,086
where every show
I would've told another joke.

552
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:50,057
You know any of them old jokes?

553
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:53,861
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

554
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,496
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

555
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,499
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

556
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:03,270
- No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr...

557
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:07,274
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

558
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:11,211
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

559
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:13,614
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

560
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,117
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

561
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:19,786
What a gyp.

562
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:23,323
Martin and Lewis.

563
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:28,795
Vanilla Coke.

564
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:39,506
You think I could
have a sip of that?

565
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,210
Be my guest.

566
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:47,314
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

567
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:50,851
- You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.

568
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:53,787
Cooties I can handle.

569
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:55,822
All right.

570
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:05,699
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

571
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:09,837
-Told ya.
-I don't know if it was worth $5,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

572
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:48,308
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?

573
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,711
Uncomfortable silences.

574
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:57,251
Why do we feel it's necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

575
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:01,255
I don't know.
That's a good question.

576
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:06,059
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

577
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:10,831
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

578
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:15,002
Well, I don't think we're quite
there yet, but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

579
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:19,640
I'll tell you what.

580
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,976
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

581
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:26,246
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

582
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,416
I'll do that.

583
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:33,687
Okay.

584
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:01,148
I said goddamn!

585
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:04,384
Goddamn!
Goddamn.

586
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,590
I need some hair spray.

587
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:21,835
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you?

588
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:24,304
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

589
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:27,508
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

590
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:30,711
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

591
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,847
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

592
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:36,250
That is Marilyn Monroe.

593
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:39,052
That is Mamie Van Doren.

594
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,057
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

595
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:47,561
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

596
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:51,999
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually, I did.

597
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,602
However...

598
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:00,340
you seem like
a really nice person, and l...

599
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:03,243
- I don't want to offend you.

600
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:08,515
This doesn't sound like
the usual, mindless, boring,
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

601
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:11,585
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

602
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:14,488
Well, well, I do. I do.

603
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:18,625
- But you have
to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

604
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:22,930
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

605
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:27,868
You can ask me what you're gonna
ask me, and my natural response
could be to get offended.

606
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:30,304
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

607
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,073
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

608
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,211
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility.

609
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:39,479
- Is that a fact?
- And besides,

610
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:44,585
- isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission?
- All right, all right.

611
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:47,454
Well, here goes.

612
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,557
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

613
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:54,061
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

614
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:57,364
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

615
00:44:57,431 --> 00:45:02,135
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

616
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:05,372
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

617
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:10,577
Yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

618
00:45:10,644 --> 00:45:13,080
- Is that a fact?
- No.

619
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:16,283
No, it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.

620
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,253
- Who told you?
- They.

621
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:21,788
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

622
00:45:23,957 --> 00:45:26,627
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

623
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:31,098
- Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did "they" say?
- I'm... I'm not shy.

624
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:33,700
- Um...
- Did it involve the "F" word?

625
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:37,771
No, no, no, no, no.
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

626
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:41,942
- And?
- And... And nothin'.

627
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:44,878
That's it.

628
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:47,014
You heard Marsellus...

629
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,451
threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

630
00:45:51,518 --> 00:45:53,453
- And you believe that?

631
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,058
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

632
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:01,228
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

633
00:46:01,295 --> 00:46:04,364
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

634
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:07,901
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

635
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:10,637
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

636
00:46:10,704 --> 00:46:15,342
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

637
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:19,146
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.

638
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:21,815
But did it happen?

639
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:27,721
Only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it... at my wedding.

640
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:30,190
Really?

641
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:33,594
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

642
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,596
except Marsellus and Tony.

643
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:39,666
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

644
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,670
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

645
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:48,775
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

646
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:55,516
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

647
00:46:55,582 --> 00:47:00,053
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

648
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,690
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

649
00:47:03,757 --> 00:47:06,026
- Right here!
- All right!

650
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:09,129
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

651
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:13,934
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

652
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:17,437
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

653
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:21,208
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

654
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,476
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

655
00:47:22,476 --> 00:47:23,810
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

656
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:26,847
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

657
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:36,723
Now let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name?

658
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,792
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

659
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,495
And how 'bout your fella here?

660
00:47:41,562 --> 00:47:43,397
Vincent Vega.

661
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:46,900
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

662
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:49,903
- Go for it.
- Come on!

663
00:48:08,188 --> 00:48:12,159
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

664
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:18,131
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

665
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,304
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

666
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:30,577
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

667
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:36,617
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale

668
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,789
The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale

669
00:48:44,658 --> 00:48:48,562
But when Pierre found work
the little money comin'
worked out well

670
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:54,935
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

671
00:48:56,637 --> 00:49:01,008
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast

672
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:07,314
Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz

673
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:13,153
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell

674
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:20,127
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

675
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:49,857
They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

676
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:55,863
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

677
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:34,268
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

678
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,704
I don't know
what you call that.

679
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:40,407
- Drinks! Music!

680
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:43,644
I'm gonna take a piss.

681
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,682
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.

682
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:03,664
Girl

683
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,599
Bomp, bomp, bom

684
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:09,169
You'll be a woman soon

685
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,808
I love you so much
Can't count all the ways

686
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:17,878
I'd die for you, girl
and all they can say is

687
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:21,148
He's not your kind

688
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:26,453
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

689
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,889
What I'm gonna find

690
00:51:28,956 --> 00:51:33,060
Don't let them
make up your mind

691
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:35,996
Don't you know, girl

692
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:41,001
You'll be a woman soon

693
00:51:41,068 --> 00:51:44,171
One drink, and that's it.

694
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:48,075
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

695
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:52,112
Say good night...
and go home.

696
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:58,652
You'll be a woman soon

697
00:51:59,853 --> 00:52:01,922
Soon

698
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:06,460
You'll be a woman

699
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,931
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

700
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:13,333
But what they're sayin', girl
it cuts like a knife

701
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,769
The boy's no good

702
00:52:15,836 --> 00:52:18,539
Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for

703
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:23,010
But if they get a chance
they'll end it for sure
Sure they would

704
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:25,779
Baby, I've done
all I could

705
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:30,517
You see, this is
a moral test of oneself.

706
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:33,854
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

707
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:37,224
Because... being loyal
is very important.

708
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:41,895
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

709
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:44,598
What I'm gonna find

710
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:48,635
Don't let them
make up your mind

711
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,538
Don't you know, girl

712
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,977
You'll be a woman soon

713
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,447
Please

714
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:04,818
Come take my hand

715
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:08,889
Girl

716
00:53:10,224 --> 00:53:14,161
You'll be a woman soon

717
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:17,497
Please

718
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:21,735
Come take my hand

719
00:53:23,437 --> 00:53:25,372
- Hello.
- Girl

720
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,878
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say, "Good night.

721
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:33,480
I've had a very lovely evening."

722
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:38,619
Walk out the door, get in
the car, go home, jerk off,
and that's all you gonna do.

723
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:46,393
Now it's up to you, girl

724
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:52,099
You'll be a woman soon

725
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,670
- Please

726
00:53:56,737 --> 00:53:59,373
Come take my hand

727
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:05,245
- Girl

728
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:09,016
- You'll be a woman soon

729
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:12,686
Soon

730
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:16,857
You'll be a woman

731
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:28,735
All right, Mia.

732
00:54:28,802 --> 00:54:31,905
So listen, I gotta go,
all right?

733
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:38,412
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

734
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:41,215
You fu...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

735
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:43,584
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me!

736
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:48,355
Oh... Come on, girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.

737
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:01,201
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

738
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:03,237
Fuck!

739
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,346
Answer.

740
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,848
- Have you got the ring?

741
00:55:14,915 --> 00:55:18,752
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.

742
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:21,255
- Please! Please!

743
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:23,957
Yes, yes.
Hold hands, you lovebirds.

744
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,366
Fuck you, Lance!
Answer!

745
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,406
Now what do you say?

746
00:55:39,473 --> 00:55:42,409
I give up!
I'll marry you!

747
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:47,114
- Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

748
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:50,784
I can hear it.

749
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,288
I thought you told those
fuckin' assholes never to
call here this late!

750
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,290
Yeah, I told them.

751
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,593
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

752
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:04,031
-
Don't you dare strike me!
- Hello.

753
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:06,333
Lance! Vincent.

754
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:09,369
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

755
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:13,507
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?

756
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:16,844
- I got this chick,
she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!

757
00:56:16,944 --> 00:56:21,281
I'm not even joking with you!
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

758
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:23,383
- No choice.
- Wh... She's O.D.in'?

759
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:26,653
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.

760
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:30,924
Okay, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet, take her
to a hospital and call a lawyer.

761
00:56:31,024 --> 00:56:33,460
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

762
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:37,231
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

763
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:40,167
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

764
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,669
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

765
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:46,039
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

766
00:56:54,147 --> 00:56:57,084
- What the hell was that?

767
00:56:59,052 --> 00:57:01,488
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

768
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:04,491
- You were talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone!
- Lance, help me.

769
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:07,494
- You crashed your car
into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

770
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:10,998
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

771
00:57:11,064 --> 00:57:14,001
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

772
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:16,503
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

773
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,506
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

774
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:24,144
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help and
let her die on your lawn.

775
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:27,181
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

776
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:30,184
- Shit.

777
00:57:32,252 --> 00:57:34,621
Lance!

778
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:36,623
Shit.

779
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,126
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

780
00:57:39,193 --> 00:57:42,529
What the fuck's going on out here?

781
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:44,531
Who's she?

782
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:47,534
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

783
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,636
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

784
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:51,772
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

785
00:57:51,872 --> 00:57:55,375
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

786
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,411
Just keep talking to her,
all right?

787
00:57:57,477 --> 00:58:00,414
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.

788
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,449
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

789
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:04,484
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before!

790
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:07,988
I don't go joy-poppin'
with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

791
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:10,490
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

792
00:58:10,557 --> 00:58:13,493
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me.
Start talking to her!

793
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,495
- Get the shot!
- All right!

794
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:22,102
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

795
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:24,104
What's he looking for?

796
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:27,107
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

797
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:30,110
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

798
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:34,248
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

799
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:37,284
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

800
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,287
- If it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot?
- I don't know!

801
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:44,291
- Stop bothering me!
- While you're looking, that girl's
gonna die on our carpet.

802
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,293
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

803
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,264
- I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!
- Lance, get in here!

804
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:54,535
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

805
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:58,071
- Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this,

806
00:58:58,138 --> 00:59:01,441
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

807
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:05,078
- Does it gotta be exact?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.

808
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:08,115
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

809
00:59:08,182 --> 00:59:11,818
- That's it.
- All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.

810
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:13,854
- You got it?
- What?

811
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:16,590
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

812
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,293
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

813
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:24,431
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.

814
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:30,103
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

815
00:59:30,204 --> 00:59:33,140
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

816
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:36,143
- I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.
- I never done this either!

817
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:39,179
I ain't starting now!
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

818
00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:42,683
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

819
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,685
Give it to me.
Give me that.

820
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:47,688
All right, tell me what to do.

821
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:50,724
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

822
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:53,760
- But she's got a breastplate...
You gotta pierce through that.

823
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:56,763
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

824
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:00,267
- I gotta... I gotta
stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

825
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:03,770
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

826
01:00:03,837 --> 01:00:06,773
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

827
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,309
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

828
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:12,346
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

829
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:15,849
- She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's...
- All right, count to three.

830
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,085
- All right. Ready?
- One.

831
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,892
Two.

832
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,868
Three!

833
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:52,686
If you're all right,
then say something.

834
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:55,789
Something.

835
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:57,824
That was fuckin' trippy.

836
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:03,730
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

837
01:01:28,422 --> 01:01:30,357
Mia. Mia.

838
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:34,962
What's...

839
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:37,798
What's your thoughts on... on...

840
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:39,900
on how to handle this?

841
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,935
What's yours?

842
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:48,909
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

843
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:52,946
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

844
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,883
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

845
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:58,018
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

846
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:00,587
I seriously doubt that.

847
01:02:00,654 --> 01:02:03,590
I can keep a secret if you can.

848
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:07,561
Shake on it?

849
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:15,068
Mum's the word?

850
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:17,070
Cool.

851
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:21,475
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

852
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,146
Vincent.

853
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:31,051
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

854
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:34,054
Sure.

855
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:37,157
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

856
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:40,160
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

857
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:43,564
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

858
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,832
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

859
01:02:45,899 --> 01:02:48,769
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

860
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:51,271
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

861
01:02:51,338 --> 01:02:55,509
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

862
01:02:55,576 --> 01:02:58,512
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

863
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:00,681
"Ketchup."

864
01:03:03,517 --> 01:03:05,452
Ketchup.

865
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,725
See you around.

866
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:36,483
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

867
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,486
He think totem pole alive!

868
01:03:39,553 --> 01:03:42,289
He arctic tenderfoot!

869
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:46,026
That totem pole been here forever!

870
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,028
- Butch?

871
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:50,964
One more thing, and we'll start for...

872
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:53,967
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

873
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:57,671
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.

874
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:05,379
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

875
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:09,183
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

876
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:12,186
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

877
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:19,459
Hello, little man.

878
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:23,630
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

879
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:26,934
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

880
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,037
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

881
01:04:30,103 --> 01:04:32,573
over five years.

882
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:34,575
Hopefully...

883
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:37,578
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

884
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:41,081
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

885
01:04:41,148 --> 01:04:43,951
for as long as we were,

886
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:48,322
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

887
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:50,324
If it'd been me who'd...

888
01:04:51,658 --> 01:04:53,594
not made it,

889
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:57,931
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

890
01:04:57,998 --> 01:05:01,668
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

891
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:05,005
Butch...

892
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,475
I got something for ya.

893
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:17,050
This watch I got here...

894
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:21,922
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.

895
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:26,660
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

896
01:05:26,727 --> 01:05:30,297
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

897
01:05:30,364 --> 01:05:33,300
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

898
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:36,537
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

899
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:39,540
on the day he set sail for Paris.

900
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:42,042
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

901
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:45,479
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

902
01:05:45,546 --> 01:05:49,116
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

903
01:05:49,183 --> 01:05:53,620
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

904
01:05:53,687 --> 01:05:58,125
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

905
01:05:58,192 --> 01:06:01,929
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

906
01:06:01,995 --> 01:06:05,465
This time they called it
World War ll.

907
01:06:05,532 --> 01:06:10,537
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

908
01:06:10,604 --> 01:06:13,607
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

909
01:06:13,674 --> 01:06:16,610
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

910
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:20,714
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

911
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:23,717
Your granddad was facing death.

912
01:06:23,784 --> 01:06:25,719
He knew it.

913
01:06:25,786 --> 01:06:29,723
None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

914
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:32,993
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

915
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:38,298
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki...

916
01:06:38,365 --> 01:06:41,301
a man he'd never met before
in his life...

917
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:44,338
to deliver to his infant son,

918
01:06:44,404 --> 01:06:49,009
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

919
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:53,413
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

920
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,751
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

921
01:06:57,818 --> 01:07:02,055
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

922
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,057
This watch.

923
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:15,369
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

924
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:18,872
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

925
01:07:18,939 --> 01:07:23,010
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

926
01:07:23,076 --> 01:07:26,613
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

927
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,384
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

928
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:34,388
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

929
01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:38,392
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something... his ass.

930
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:41,895
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

931
01:07:41,962 --> 01:07:46,166
Then he died of dysentery...
He give me the watch.

932
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:50,103
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

933
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,105
Then...

934
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:56,243
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

935
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,245
now...

936
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:03,617
Iittle man,
I give the watch to you.

937
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:28,408
It's time, Butch.

938
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:39,086
In the heavyweight division,

939
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:42,322
- in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks,

940
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:45,659
weighing 210 pounds,

941
01:08:45,726 --> 01:08:48,862
Floyd Ray Wilson!

942
01:08:51,932 --> 01:08:53,867
It's official. It's official.

943
01:08:53,934 --> 01:08:56,870
- Wilson is dead!
- Well, Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest,

944
01:08:56,937 --> 01:08:59,373
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

945
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,043
Coolidge was out of there
faster than I've ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring.

946
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:06,046
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.

947
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:09,550
I could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

948
01:09:09,616 --> 01:09:13,053
- I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy...

949
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,055
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?

950
01:09:15,122 --> 01:09:19,059
A tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations.

951
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:23,063
It's of paramount importance,
during the sad weeks ahead,
the eyes of the W.B.A. remain...

952
01:09:57,898 --> 01:10:00,234
Man, you know I didn't...

953
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,237
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

954
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:05,239
I didn't do it.

955
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:07,808
- How you doing?
- Great.

956
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,310
I never thanked you
for dinner.

957
01:10:12,212 --> 01:10:14,147
- What you got?
- He booked.

958
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:17,317
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

959
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:20,821
- I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna "think."

960
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:24,491
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

961
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:27,995
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

962
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:29,997
Butch's search...
How do you want it done?

963
01:10:30,063 --> 01:10:33,000
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

964
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:36,503
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

965
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:38,705
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

966
01:10:38,772 --> 01:10:40,908
I will take care of it.

967
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:53,020
Mister.

968
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:58,425
- Hey, mister.
- What?

969
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:03,297
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

970
01:11:03,363 --> 01:11:06,800
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

971
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:09,636
No, come on.

972
01:11:09,703 --> 01:11:11,638
You're him.

973
01:11:11,705 --> 01:11:14,141
I know you're him.

974
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:17,778
Tell me you're him.

975
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:19,780
I'm him.

976
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:23,317
You killed the other boxing man.

977
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:29,056
He's dead?

978
01:11:29,122 --> 01:11:31,558
The radio said he was dead.

979
01:11:34,328 --> 01:11:36,563
Sorry about that, Floyd.

980
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:40,367
What does it feel like?

981
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:42,369
What does what feel like?

982
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:44,371
Killing a man.

983
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:50,210
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

984
01:11:50,277 --> 01:11:52,212
What are you, a weirdo?

985
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:54,214
No.

986
01:11:54,281 --> 01:11:57,718
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

987
01:11:59,286 --> 01:12:03,223
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

988
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:08,161
So?

989
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:11,498
- What does it feel like to kill a man?

990
01:12:12,599 --> 01:12:14,535
I'll tell you what.

991
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:18,539
Give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there, and I'll
tell you all about it.

992
01:12:36,256 --> 01:12:39,493
So, Esmeralda...

993
01:12:40,794 --> 01:12:44,198
Villa Lobos...
Is that Mexican?

994
01:12:44,264 --> 01:12:47,501
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

995
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:50,871
- That's some handle
you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

996
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:52,873
And what is your name?

997
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,641
Butch.

998
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:57,177
Butch.

999
01:12:57,244 --> 01:13:02,015
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1000
01:13:02,082 --> 01:13:04,751
So, moving right along,

1001
01:13:04,818 --> 01:13:06,753
Esmeralda,

1002
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:09,089
what is it you want to know?

1003
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:14,027
- I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1004
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:24,371
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1005
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:29,042
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1006
01:13:32,779 --> 01:13:36,216
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1007
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:49,630
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1008
01:13:49,696 --> 01:13:53,634
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man, the odds
went through the roof.

1009
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,903
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1010
01:13:55,969 --> 01:13:59,406
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1011
01:13:59,473 --> 01:14:01,408
If he never
laced up his gloves,

1012
01:14:01,475 --> 01:14:03,911
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1013
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:09,583
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1014
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,586
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1015
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:16,356
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1016
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:19,359
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1017
01:14:19,426 --> 01:14:21,862
All eight?
How long to collect?

1018
01:14:23,497 --> 01:14:26,433
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night? No, I understand.

1019
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,670
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1020
01:14:29,736 --> 01:14:31,972
That is great news, man.

1021
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:36,243
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1022
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:39,580
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1023
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,582
Okay, my brother.

1024
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:43,617
You're right.

1025
01:14:43,684 --> 01:14:46,019
You're goddamn right.

1026
01:14:46,086 --> 01:14:49,590
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1027
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:51,992
Cool, brother.

1028
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,576
$45.60.

1029
01:15:13,146 --> 01:15:15,082
And, uh,

1030
01:15:15,148 --> 01:15:18,452
here's a little something
for the effort.

1031
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:22,456
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1032
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:24,458
The truth.

1033
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:28,028
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1034
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,332
Bonsoir,
Esmeralda Villa Lobos.

1035
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,935
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1036
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,981
Whew.

1037
01:15:49,349 --> 01:15:51,351
Keep the light off.

1038
01:15:51,418 --> 01:15:54,354
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1039
01:15:58,825 --> 01:16:00,761
Hard day at the office?

1040
01:16:00,827 --> 01:16:02,763
Pretty hard.

1041
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:05,065
Got in a fight.

1042
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:07,301
Poor baby.

1043
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:09,937
Can you make spoons?

1044
01:16:10,003 --> 01:16:12,940
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1045
01:16:13,006 --> 01:16:16,944
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1046
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:19,446
Let me take this jacket off.

1047
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:25,152
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1048
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:27,154
I wish I had a pot.

1049
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:32,860
You were looking
at yourself in the mirror,
and you wish you had some pot?

1050
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:35,863
A pot.
A pot belly.

1051
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:38,098
Pot bellies are sexy.

1052
01:16:38,165 --> 01:16:40,467
Well, you should be happy,

1053
01:16:40,534 --> 01:16:42,469
'cause you have one.

1054
01:16:42,536 --> 01:16:46,006
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1055
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:49,943
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1056
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,945
It's not the same thing.

1057
01:16:52,012 --> 01:16:55,949
I didn't know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy.

1058
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:57,951
The difference is huge.

1059
01:16:58,018 --> 01:17:01,455
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1060
01:17:01,522 --> 01:17:03,457
No.

1061
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:07,961
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1062
01:17:08,028 --> 01:17:11,131
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1063
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:16,637
The rest of you is normal... normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...

1064
01:17:16,703 --> 01:17:20,774
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1065
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:23,777
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1066
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:25,779
to accentuate it.

1067
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:28,282
You think men
would find that attractive?

1068
01:17:28,348 --> 01:17:31,518
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1069
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:35,055
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1070
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:37,057
is seldom the same.

1071
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:44,064
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1072
01:17:44,131 --> 01:17:47,067
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1073
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:49,069
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1074
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:53,073
- I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!

1075
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,075
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1076
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:57,110
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1077
01:18:10,657 --> 01:18:12,593
Did you get everything?

1078
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:15,662
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1079
01:18:15,729 --> 01:18:17,664
Did everything
go as planned?

1080
01:18:17,731 --> 01:18:20,467
- You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1081
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:22,469
You didn't listen to the radio?

1082
01:18:22,536 --> 01:18:25,839
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1083
01:18:25,906 --> 01:18:28,208
I won, all right.

1084
01:18:28,275 --> 01:18:31,245
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1085
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:33,680
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1086
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:38,552
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1087
01:18:46,493 --> 01:18:49,363
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1088
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:53,867
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1089
01:18:55,936 --> 01:18:58,872
But they won't find us,
will they?

1090
01:19:01,775 --> 01:19:04,711
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1091
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,950
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's...

1092
01:19:16,557 --> 01:19:18,926
Say it.

1093
01:19:18,992 --> 01:19:21,595
- Fabienne,

1094
01:19:21,662 --> 01:19:24,798
I want you to be with me.

1095
01:19:24,865 --> 01:19:27,868
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1096
01:19:30,003 --> 01:19:31,972
Do you love me?

1097
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:34,041
Very, very much.

1098
01:19:39,746 --> 01:19:42,316
- Butch.
- Yes?

1099
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,353
Will you give me
oral pleasure?

1100
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:49,790
Will you kiss it?

1101
01:19:51,725 --> 01:19:53,927
But you first.

1102
01:19:53,994 --> 01:19:56,830
- Okay.
- Okay.

1103
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,343
Butch.

1104
01:20:09,409 --> 01:20:12,846
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1105
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:30,964
I think I cracked a rib.

1106
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:34,468
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1107
01:20:34,535 --> 01:20:37,971
- Don't call me "retard."
- My name is Fabby.

1108
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:40,507
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1109
01:20:40,607 --> 01:20:42,543
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi...

1110
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:45,546
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1111
01:20:45,612 --> 01:20:48,682
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1112
01:20:48,782 --> 01:20:51,718
- I take it back.

1113
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,657
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1114
01:20:56,723 --> 01:21:00,661
- Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1115
01:21:00,727 --> 01:21:03,163
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

1116
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:06,166
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1117
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:08,335
And I took it back.

1118
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:10,504
- Butch?

1119
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:12,539
Yes, Lemon Pie?

1120
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:16,043
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1121
01:21:16,109 --> 01:21:18,212
Wherever you want.

1122
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:21,248
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1123
01:21:21,315 --> 01:21:24,251
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1124
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:27,254
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1125
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:31,258
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1126
01:21:31,325 --> 01:21:34,761
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1127
01:21:34,828 --> 01:21:37,764
- If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1128
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:41,268
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.

1129
01:21:41,335 --> 01:21:43,270
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1130
01:21:43,337 --> 01:21:45,272
But I do not speak Spanish.

1131
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:48,308
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1132
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,344
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1133
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:53,347
- ¿ Donde esta el zapateria?
- What does that mean?

1134
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:55,349
Where is the shoe store?

1135
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:57,351
- ¿ Donde esta...
- Spit, please.

1136
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:02,656
- ¿ Donde esta el zapateria?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1137
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:08,161
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1138
01:22:08,228 --> 01:22:10,731
- ¿ Que hora es?
- ¿ Que hora es?

1139
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:12,966
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1140
01:22:13,066 --> 01:22:15,669
Time for bed.

1141
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:17,704
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1142
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:27,347
Butch?

1143
01:22:33,253 --> 01:22:35,189
Never mind.

1144
01:22:44,865 --> 01:22:48,902
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1145
01:22:59,379 --> 01:23:03,617
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1146
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:05,652
I'm not sure the name.

1147
01:23:07,554 --> 01:23:10,624
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1148
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:16,530
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1149
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:23,837
- What was it about?
- How should I know?
You were the one watching it.

1150
01:23:23,904 --> 01:23:27,875
- No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1151
01:23:27,975 --> 01:23:29,910
I don't remember.

1152
01:23:29,977 --> 01:23:32,913
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1153
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,949
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1154
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:40,954
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1155
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:43,624
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1156
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,996
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1157
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:52,533
- Get up, lazy bones!
- Ohh!

1158
01:23:52,599 --> 01:23:55,636
- Ohh. God.

1159
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,474
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1160
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:04,311
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.

1161
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:08,782
- You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?
- What, Lemon Pie?

1162
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:12,953
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1163
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,988
with maple syrup,

1164
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:18,492
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1165
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:20,727
Anything to drink with that?

1166
01:24:20,827 --> 01:24:24,464
Wow, that looks nice.

1167
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:27,901
To drink... A tall glass
of orange juice...

1168
01:24:27,968 --> 01:24:30,404
and a black cup of coffee.

1169
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:35,008
- After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1170
01:24:35,108 --> 01:24:39,046
- Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1171
01:24:39,112 --> 01:24:42,049
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1172
01:24:42,115 --> 01:24:45,085
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1173
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:47,120
Where's my watch?

1174
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:53,827
It's there.

1175
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:56,496
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1176
01:24:56,597 --> 01:25:00,834
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1177
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:03,036
You sure you got it?

1178
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:05,405
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1179
01:25:05,506 --> 01:25:08,642
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1180
01:25:08,742 --> 01:25:11,879
Yeah, well,
it's not here now.

1181
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:14,848
- Well, it should be.

1182
01:25:14,915 --> 01:25:18,685
Yes, it most definitely should be,
but it's not here now!
So where the fuck is it?

1183
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:27,728
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch?

1184
01:25:29,396 --> 01:25:33,834
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1185
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:36,837
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1186
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:42,242
All this other shit you could've set
on fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget the fucking watch.

1187
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:43,644
Now think.

1188
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:47,214
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1189
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:50,551
"You believe so"?
What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.

1190
01:25:51,985 --> 01:25:53,921
Then I did.

1191
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:57,224
Are you sure?

1192
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:00,260
No.

1193
01:26:02,362 --> 01:26:04,298
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1194
01:26:04,364 --> 01:26:06,733
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'...

1195
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:11,405
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1196
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:13,440
No!

1197
01:26:16,076 --> 01:26:18,011
It's not your fault.

1198
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:25,252
You left it at the apartment.

1199
01:26:30,824 --> 01:26:34,261
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1200
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:39,433
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1201
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:43,604
I reminded you about it,

1202
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:48,408
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1203
01:26:48,509 --> 01:26:52,513
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1204
01:26:52,613 --> 01:26:55,048
You're not a mind reader.

1205
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:57,050
Are you?

1206
01:27:07,194 --> 01:27:09,129
I... I'm sorry.

1207
01:27:09,196 --> 01:27:12,766
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1208
01:27:12,866 --> 01:27:15,536
Why does it mean that?

1209
01:27:18,138 --> 01:27:21,441
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1210
01:27:22,676 --> 01:27:25,179
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1211
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:29,516
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1212
01:27:29,616 --> 01:27:32,819
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1213
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,855
then I'll split.

1214
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:39,193
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1215
01:27:44,498 --> 01:27:47,534
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1216
01:27:47,634 --> 01:27:49,469
Have a nice breakfast.

1217
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:53,006
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."

1218
01:27:53,073 --> 01:27:55,509
Blueberry pie.

1219
01:27:55,576 --> 01:27:57,711
Maybe not that fast.

1220
01:27:57,811 --> 01:28:00,981
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1221
01:28:01,081 --> 01:28:03,383
- Bye.
- Bye.

1222
01:28:03,483 --> 01:28:06,420
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1223
01:28:06,486 --> 01:28:08,422
she forgets my father's watch!

1224
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:10,424
I specifically reminded her...

1225
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,593
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1226
01:28:12,693 --> 01:28:15,929
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1227
01:28:31,445 --> 01:28:34,882
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's
nearest you...

1228
01:28:45,025 --> 01:28:49,162
i EI burro!

1229
01:30:52,853 --> 01:30:54,788
Lookin' good, Butch.

1230
01:33:43,891 --> 01:33:45,959
lf I were walkin'
in your shoes

1231
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:58,939
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all

1232
01:33:59,006 --> 01:34:03,443
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1233
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:06,446
That's how you're gonna
beat 'em, Butch.

1234
01:34:06,513 --> 01:34:09,750
- Smokin' cigarettes and
watchin' Captain Kangaroo
- They keep underestimatin' ya.

1235
01:34:09,816 --> 01:34:11,752
Now don't tell me

1236
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,790
Countin' flowers on the wall

1237
01:34:16,857 --> 01:34:20,327
That don't bother me at all

1238
01:34:20,394 --> 01:34:25,933
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1239
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:30,737
Smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo

1240
01:34:30,804 --> 01:34:33,707
Now don't tell me

1241
01:34:33,774 --> 01:34:36,210
I've nothin' to do

1242
01:34:36,276 --> 01:34:38,579
It's good to see you
I must go

1243
01:34:38,645 --> 01:34:40,714
I know I look a fright

1244
01:34:40,781 --> 01:34:43,250
- Anyway my eyes
- Motherfucker.

1245
01:34:43,317 --> 01:34:45,686
- Are not accustomed...

1246
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:56,296
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

1247
01:34:56,363 --> 01:34:58,599
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1248
01:35:08,475 --> 01:35:12,412
If you need someone to go
to court, I'll be glad to help.
That guy was a drunken maniac.

1249
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:15,415
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.

1250
01:35:15,482 --> 01:35:17,417
- Who?
- Him.

1251
01:35:21,488 --> 01:35:23,690
I'll be damned.

1252
01:35:39,339 --> 01:35:41,642
- Aaaah! I'm shot!

1253
01:35:48,448 --> 01:35:51,852
- Sally! Sally!

1254
01:35:59,626 --> 01:36:01,562
Motherfucker!

1255
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:07,668
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.

1256
01:36:07,734 --> 01:36:10,671
Now you just wait
a goddamn minute, now!

1257
01:36:10,737 --> 01:36:12,706
What the fuck you up to?

1258
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:15,409
- Come here, motherfucker!

1259
01:36:15,475 --> 01:36:18,378
- You feel that sting, huh, big boy?

1260
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:20,380
That's pride
fuckin' with you, see?

1261
01:36:20,447 --> 01:36:23,884
You gotta fight through that shit!

1262
01:36:23,951 --> 01:36:26,954
- You'd better kill me...
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1263
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:29,590
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to...

1264
01:36:29,656 --> 01:36:32,192
- Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1265
01:36:32,259 --> 01:36:36,029
- This ain't none
of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1266
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,832
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1267
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:40,934
Toss the weapon.

1268
01:36:43,003 --> 01:36:46,173
It's time

1269
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,942
- To find love
- Take your foot off the nigger,

1270
01:36:49,009 --> 01:36:50,944
- put your hand behind your head,

1271
01:36:51,011 --> 01:36:53,080
approach the counter right now.

1272
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:55,182
- This motherfucker's trying to...

1273
01:36:55,249 --> 01:36:56,583
kill me.

1274
01:36:56,650 --> 01:37:00,420
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.

1275
01:37:01,922 --> 01:37:05,459
lf love

1276
01:37:05,526 --> 01:37:07,461
Is shelter

1277
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:26,947
Zed. Maynard.

1278
01:37:28,115 --> 01:37:31,051
Yeah, the spider
just caught a couple flies.

1279
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:34,555
Whoa, my angel

1280
01:37:37,124 --> 01:37:39,826
Down to you

1281
01:37:39,826 --> 01:37:40,260
Down to you

1282
01:38:18,899 --> 01:38:21,835
Nobody kills anybody
in my place of business...

1283
01:38:21,902 --> 01:38:24,838
- except me or Zed.

1284
01:38:27,107 --> 01:38:29,042
That's Zed.

1285
01:38:41,688 --> 01:38:45,125
- I thought
you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1286
01:38:49,429 --> 01:38:52,366
Then how come they're all beat up?

1287
01:38:52,432 --> 01:38:56,670
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1288
01:38:56,770 --> 01:39:01,074
Now, this 'un right here,
he was gonna shoot that one.

1289
01:39:01,175 --> 01:39:04,545
Is that right?
You gonna shoot him, boy?

1290
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:07,181
Huh?

1291
01:39:09,216 --> 01:39:12,252
Hey, is Grace
all right out front?

1292
01:39:12,352 --> 01:39:15,556
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.

1293
01:39:15,656 --> 01:39:18,225
- She oughta be fine.
- Mmm.

1294
01:39:19,726 --> 01:39:23,964
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1295
01:39:25,098 --> 01:39:27,801
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1296
01:39:27,901 --> 01:39:31,839
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?

1297
01:40:10,944 --> 01:40:12,880
Get up.

1298
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,095
Get down.

1299
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:41,108
Which one of'em
you wanna do first?

1300
01:40:41,175 --> 01:40:44,878
- I ain't for sure yet.

1301
01:40:48,448 --> 01:40:51,084
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

1302
01:40:51,185 --> 01:40:53,754
catch a nigger...

1303
01:40:53,854 --> 01:40:56,423
by his toe.

1304
01:40:56,523 --> 01:41:00,260
If he hollers, let him go.

1305
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:04,464
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1306
01:41:07,534 --> 01:41:10,370
My mother said...

1307
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:14,041
pick the perfect one,

1308
01:41:14,141 --> 01:41:17,110
and... you... are...

1309
01:41:18,579 --> 01:41:20,514
it.

1310
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:25,886
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!

1311
01:41:30,257 --> 01:41:34,795
- You wanna do it in here?
- No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1312
01:41:34,895 --> 01:41:37,598
Sounds good to me.

1313
01:42:01,555 --> 01:42:04,625
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1314
01:42:37,658 --> 01:42:40,827
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1315
01:42:40,928 --> 01:42:44,364
- Now, motherfucker!
Aaah!

1316
01:42:44,431 --> 01:42:48,869
- Come on! Yeah!

1317
01:43:05,018 --> 01:43:06,987
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

1318
01:43:09,456 --> 01:43:12,893
- Yeah! Yeah!

1319
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:17,331
Yeee!
Yeeee-hah!

1320
01:43:37,985 --> 01:43:39,920
Yeah!

1321

Come on!
Get down there!

1322
01:44:13,954 --> 01:44:17,157
Aaah!
Do it! Yeah!

1323
01:44:34,308 --> 01:44:37,277
Yeah! Yeah!

1324
01:44:52,793 --> 01:44:56,230
- Shut the fuck up!

1325
01:44:57,998 --> 01:44:59,933
Fuck him!

1326
01:45:02,102 --> 01:45:04,037
Come on!

1327
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:11,078
- Fuck him. Yeah.

1328
01:45:41,808 --> 01:45:44,044
You want that gun,
don't ya, Zed?

1329
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:50,584
Go ahead and pick it up.

1330
01:45:52,986 --> 01:45:55,322
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1331
01:45:57,591 --> 01:46:00,093
Come on...
Thatta boy!

1332
01:46:01,662 --> 01:46:05,766
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1333
01:46:10,003 --> 01:46:13,073
- Step aside, Butch.

1334
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:28,355
Fuck!

1335
01:46:30,958 --> 01:46:33,894
- You okay?

1336
01:46:35,262 --> 01:46:37,431
No, man.

1337
01:46:37,497 --> 01:46:40,434
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1338
01:46:51,612 --> 01:46:54,548
- What now?

1339
01:46:56,884 --> 01:46:58,819
"What now"?

1340
01:47:00,187 --> 01:47:03,624
- Let me tell you what now.

1341
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:06,627
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1342
01:47:06,693 --> 01:47:09,630
to go to work
on the homes here...

1343
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:12,633
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1344
01:47:14,601 --> 01:47:17,304
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy?

1345
01:47:18,572 --> 01:47:21,141
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!

1346
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:24,144
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1347
01:47:27,414 --> 01:47:30,350
I meant what now
between me and you.

1348
01:47:35,422 --> 01:47:37,824
Oh, that "what now."

1349
01:47:39,259 --> 01:47:43,197
- I tell you what now
between me and you.

1350
01:47:44,765 --> 01:47:47,701
There is no me and you.

1351
01:47:49,136 --> 01:47:51,071
Not no more.

1352
01:47:54,141 --> 01:47:56,076
So, are we cool?

1353
01:47:57,444 --> 01:47:59,746
Yeah, we cool.

1354
01:47:59,813 --> 01:48:01,949
- Two things.

1355
01:48:03,717 --> 01:48:06,653
Don't tell nobody about this.

1356
01:48:08,121 --> 01:48:11,758
This shit is between me, you...

1357
01:48:11,825 --> 01:48:16,296
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin'
The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-
Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...

1358
01:48:16,363 --> 01:48:18,298
rapist here.

1359
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,369
It ain't nobody else's business.

1360
01:48:22,436 --> 01:48:24,371
Two:

1361
01:48:24,438 --> 01:48:27,941
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1362
01:48:29,176 --> 01:48:31,111
And when you gone,

1363
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:33,113
you stay gone,

1364
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:36,116
- or you be gone.

1365
01:48:36,183 --> 01:48:39,119
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?

1366
01:48:40,954 --> 01:48:42,890
Deal.

1367
01:48:44,124 --> 01:48:46,059
Get your ass outta here.

1368
01:49:12,519 --> 01:49:14,755
Oh, shit.

1369
01:49:47,754 --> 01:49:50,190
Fabienne!

1370
01:49:51,258 --> 01:49:54,194
Fabienne!

1371
01:49:55,429 --> 01:49:57,531
Fabienne!
Come on, baby.

1372
01:49:57,598 --> 01:50:01,034
- Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.

1373
01:50:01,101 --> 01:50:04,538
- What about our bags?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1374
01:50:04,605 --> 01:50:06,540
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1375
01:50:06,607 --> 01:50:10,544
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1376
01:50:14,047 --> 01:50:15,983
Come on, honey!

1377
01:50:18,051 --> 01:50:20,521
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1378
01:50:20,587 --> 01:50:25,125
- It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

1379
01:50:25,192 --> 01:50:28,962
I'm sorry, baby,
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

1380
01:50:29,029 --> 01:50:31,431
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1381
01:50:36,003 --> 01:50:39,439
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1382
01:50:39,506 --> 01:50:42,442
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we...

1383
01:50:42,509 --> 01:50:45,445
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1384
01:50:47,114 --> 01:50:50,551
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.

1385
01:50:50,617 --> 01:50:52,553
I'm sorry.

1386
01:50:52,619 --> 01:50:56,557
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

1387
01:50:56,623 --> 01:50:59,560
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1388
01:50:59,626 --> 01:51:01,562
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1389
01:51:01,628 --> 01:51:03,564
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1390
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:07,568
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1391
01:51:07,634 --> 01:51:10,571
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1392
01:51:10,637 --> 01:51:13,874
the single weirdest
fuckin' day of my life...
I'll tell you all about it.

1393
01:51:13,941 --> 01:51:15,809
Gotta go. Come on.

1394
01:51:15,876 --> 01:51:18,645
Butch, whose motorcycle
is this?

1395
01:51:18,712 --> 01:51:21,315
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1396
01:51:21,381 --> 01:51:23,317
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1397
01:51:23,383 --> 01:51:25,953
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.

1398
01:51:42,135 --> 01:51:44,438
Yes, you did, Brett!

1399
01:51:44,505 --> 01:51:48,041
You tried to fuck him,
and Marsellus Wallace
don't liked to be fucked...

1400
01:51:48,108 --> 01:51:50,544
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1401
01:51:50,611 --> 01:51:53,714
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1402
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:57,217
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1403
01:51:57,284 --> 01:51:59,453
Sorta fits the occasion.

1404
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,823
Ezekiel 25:17.

1405
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:07,194
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1406
01:52:07,261 --> 01:52:09,196
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1407
01:52:09,263 --> 01:52:12,699
- and the tyranny of evil men.

1408
01:52:12,766 --> 01:52:17,437
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,

1409
01:52:17,504 --> 01:52:20,541
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1410
01:52:20,607 --> 01:52:23,143
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

1411
01:52:23,210 --> 01:52:25,946
and the finder
of lost children.

1412
01:52:26,013 --> 01:52:30,284
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

1413
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:32,519
and furious anger...

1414
01:52:32,586 --> 01:52:36,990
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1415
01:52:37,057 --> 01:52:40,928
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

1416
01:52:40,994 --> 01:52:44,398
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1417
01:52:52,472 --> 01:52:54,908
I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1418
01:52:54,975 --> 01:52:57,911
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1419
01:52:57,978 --> 01:53:00,914
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1420
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:03,917
- Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.

1421
01:53:03,984 --> 01:53:07,187
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1422
01:53:07,254 --> 01:53:11,425
- Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1423
01:53:39,586 --> 01:53:43,023
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1424
01:53:43,090 --> 01:53:45,959
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...

1425
01:53:46,026 --> 01:53:47,961
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1426
01:53:48,028 --> 01:53:51,965
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1427
01:53:56,737 --> 01:53:59,439
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1428
01:53:59,506 --> 01:54:01,441
I know.
We was lucky.

1429
01:54:01,508 --> 01:54:04,645
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1430
01:54:04,711 --> 01:54:08,916
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1431
01:54:08,982 --> 01:54:10,918
You know what
divine intervention is?

1432
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:18,725
I think so.

1433
01:54:18,792 --> 01:54:22,229
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1434
01:54:22,296 --> 01:54:24,731
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1435
01:54:24,798 --> 01:54:27,768
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1436
01:54:29,002 --> 01:54:31,004
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1437
01:54:31,071 --> 01:54:33,507
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1438
01:54:33,574 --> 01:54:37,511
- What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill. This shit happens.

1439
01:54:37,578 --> 01:54:40,347
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."

1440
01:54:40,414 --> 01:54:43,851
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1441
01:54:43,917 --> 01:54:46,353
or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

1442
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:49,056
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1443
01:54:49,122 --> 01:54:53,360
What happened here was a miracle, and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1444
01:54:53,427 --> 01:54:58,131
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1445
01:55:05,138 --> 01:55:08,509
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1446
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:12,179
You ever seen that show Cops?

1447
01:55:12,279 --> 01:55:15,215
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1448
01:55:15,282 --> 01:55:19,219
and he was talkin' about this
gunfight he had in the hallway
with this guy, right?

1449
01:55:19,286 --> 01:55:22,723
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1450
01:55:22,823 --> 01:55:25,759
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1451
01:55:25,826 --> 01:55:29,129
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1452
01:55:29,229 --> 01:55:34,168
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd,
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1453
01:55:34,234 --> 01:55:37,171
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1454
01:55:37,237 --> 01:55:39,907
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1455
01:55:40,007 --> 01:55:42,142
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1456
01:55:42,242 --> 01:55:45,279
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin'
freakin' out on us?

1457
01:55:45,379 --> 01:55:48,415
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today...
I'm through.

1458
01:55:48,515 --> 01:55:51,451
- Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.

1459
01:55:51,518 --> 01:55:55,489
- And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1460
01:55:55,589 --> 01:55:58,659
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1461
01:55:58,759 --> 01:56:01,195
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1462
01:56:01,261 --> 01:56:05,465
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped...

1463
01:56:05,566 --> 01:56:07,534
- What the fuck's happenin'?

1464
01:56:07,634 --> 01:56:09,570
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!

1465
01:56:09,636 --> 01:56:12,573
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1466
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:14,575
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1467
01:56:14,641 --> 01:56:17,578
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this...
- Chill out, man!

1468
01:56:17,644 --> 01:56:20,581
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1469
01:56:20,647 --> 01:56:22,583
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1470
01:56:22,649 --> 01:56:25,953
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1471
01:56:26,053 --> 01:56:29,489
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1472
01:56:29,556 --> 01:56:32,492
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1473
01:56:32,559 --> 01:56:35,996
We gotta get this car off
the road. Cops notice shit
like a car drenched in blood.

1474
01:56:36,096 --> 01:56:39,032
- Just take it to
a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1475
01:56:39,099 --> 01:56:41,502
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1476
01:56:41,602 --> 01:56:44,538
- Well, Jules, this ain't
my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!

1477
01:56:44,605 --> 01:56:47,541
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1478
01:56:47,608 --> 01:56:51,111
-Where's Toluca Lake?
-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1479
01:56:51,211 --> 01:56:54,147
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1480
01:56:54,214 --> 01:56:57,150
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1481
01:56:57,217 --> 01:57:00,153
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1482
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:04,157
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1483
01:57:04,224 --> 01:57:06,393
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1484
01:57:07,928 --> 01:57:10,864
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1485
01:57:10,931 --> 01:57:14,535
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1486
01:57:14,635 --> 01:57:17,571
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls,

1487
01:57:17,638 --> 01:57:20,574
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch... Jimmie's a friend.

1488
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:23,577
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1489
01:57:23,644 --> 01:57:25,579
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1490
01:57:25,646 --> 01:57:27,581
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1491
01:57:27,648 --> 01:57:30,784
Put yourself in his position...
It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.

1492
01:57:30,884 --> 01:57:32,819
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1493
01:57:32,886 --> 01:57:35,822
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1494
01:57:35,889 --> 01:57:39,826
If that favor means I gotta
take shit, he can stick that
favor straight up his ass.

1495
01:57:39,893 --> 01:57:43,830
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?
- I was dryin' my hands!

1496
01:57:43,897 --> 01:57:46,834
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1497
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:50,437
- I watched you get'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

1498
01:57:50,537 --> 01:57:52,472
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1499
01:57:52,539 --> 01:57:54,474
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1500
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:57,477
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1501
01:57:57,544 --> 01:58:00,480
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1502
01:58:00,547 --> 01:58:04,618
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1503
01:58:04,718 --> 01:58:08,155
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1504
01:58:08,222 --> 01:58:12,659
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me
in this position, all right?

1505
01:58:12,759 --> 01:58:15,429
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1506
01:58:15,529 --> 01:58:18,465
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1507
01:58:18,532 --> 01:58:21,468
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1508
01:58:23,203 --> 01:58:26,039
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!

1509
01:58:26,139 --> 01:58:28,208
This some serious
gourmet shit.

1510
01:58:28,308 --> 01:58:30,244
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1511
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:32,279
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1512
01:58:32,346 --> 01:58:34,281
Right?

1513
01:58:34,348 --> 01:58:37,284
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1514
01:58:37,351 --> 01:58:39,386
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1515
01:58:39,486 --> 01:58:43,490
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1516
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:46,059
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1517
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:48,095
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1518
01:58:48,161 --> 01:58:51,765
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1519
01:58:51,865 --> 01:58:55,802
But you know what's on
my mind right now? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.

1520
01:58:55,869 --> 01:58:58,005
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1521
01:58:58,105 --> 01:59:01,542
- Jimmie, don't even worry...
- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1522
01:59:01,608 --> 01:59:03,544
When you came pulling in here,

1523
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:06,780
did you notice the sign
on the front of my house that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1524
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,317
- You know I ain't seen no...
- Did you notice the sign on
the front of my house...

1525
01:59:10,384 --> 01:59:12,319
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1526
01:59:12,386 --> 01:59:15,088
No. I didn't.

1527
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:18,125
- You know why you didn't
see that sign?
- Why?

1528
01:59:18,192 --> 01:59:22,696
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1529
01:59:22,796 --> 01:59:25,732
- We're not gonna store
the motherfucker...
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1530
01:59:25,799 --> 01:59:30,237
that if Bonnie comes home and
finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced?

1531
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:33,507
No marriage counselor.
No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1532
01:59:33,607 --> 01:59:36,944
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1533
01:59:37,044 --> 01:59:42,015
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1534
01:59:42,115 --> 01:59:44,184
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1535
01:59:44,284 --> 01:59:48,222
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1536
01:59:48,288 --> 01:59:52,226
There's nothin' you're gonna
say that's gonna make me forget
I love my wife. Is there?

1537
01:59:55,395 --> 02:00:00,033
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1538
02:00:00,133 --> 02:00:03,170
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1539
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:06,306
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1540
02:00:06,406 --> 02:00:10,344
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1541
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:13,347
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1542
02:00:13,413 --> 02:00:16,383
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1543
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:19,386
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

1544
02:00:19,453 --> 02:00:22,523
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1545
02:00:22,623 --> 02:00:26,093
Do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

1546
02:00:26,193 --> 02:00:29,129
Well, say she comes home.

1547
02:00:29,196 --> 02:00:31,632
What do you think she'll do?

1548
02:00:33,133 --> 02:00:35,536
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1549
02:00:35,636 --> 02:00:37,804
That ain't no kinda answer.

1550
02:00:37,905 --> 02:00:40,941
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1551
02:00:41,041 --> 02:00:43,877
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1552
02:00:43,977 --> 02:00:45,913
this Bonnie situation is.

1553
02:00:45,979 --> 02:00:49,917
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters
in her kitchen...

1554
02:00:49,983 --> 02:00:51,919
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1555
02:00:51,985 --> 02:00:55,022
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1556
02:00:57,224 --> 02:00:59,159
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1557
02:00:59,226 --> 02:01:01,795
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1558
02:01:01,895 --> 02:01:04,831
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1559
02:01:04,898 --> 02:01:08,836
All I want to hear from your ass
is, "You ain't got no problem,
Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1560
02:01:08,902 --> 02:01:13,040
Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."

1561
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:16,276
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1562
02:01:16,376 --> 02:01:18,478
I'm on the motherfucker.

1563
02:01:18,579 --> 02:01:23,617
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1564
02:01:23,717 --> 02:01:26,119
You sendin' the Wolf?

1565
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:28,388
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1566
02:01:28,488 --> 02:01:30,724
Shit, yeah, negro!

1567
02:01:30,824 --> 02:01:33,927
That's all you had to say!

1568
02:01:34,027 --> 02:01:37,197
- She the hysterical type?

1569
02:01:37,297 --> 02:01:40,234
- When is she due?

1570
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:44,404
Give me
the principals' names again.

1571
02:01:44,471 --> 02:01:46,406
Place your bets.

1572
02:01:47,474 --> 02:01:51,111
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

1573
02:01:51,211 --> 02:01:53,146
Vincent.

1574
02:01:57,885 --> 02:01:59,786
Jimmie.

1575
02:02:01,054 --> 02:02:03,156
Bonnie.

1576
02:02:08,595 --> 02:02:11,665
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1577
02:02:28,482 --> 02:02:31,418
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1578
02:02:31,485 --> 02:02:35,122
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1579
02:02:35,189 --> 02:02:38,125
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1580
02:02:38,192 --> 02:02:40,127
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1581
02:02:40,194 --> 02:02:43,864
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1582
02:02:43,931 --> 02:02:46,366
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1583
02:02:46,433 --> 02:02:49,369
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1584
02:02:49,436 --> 02:02:51,371
Uh, one hundred percent.

1585
02:02:51,438 --> 02:02:55,375
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
- Uh-huh.

1586
02:02:55,442 --> 02:02:59,947
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1587
02:03:00,013 --> 02:03:04,318
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1588
02:03:04,384 --> 02:03:07,821
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1589
02:03:07,888 --> 02:03:12,226
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

1590
02:03:19,967 --> 02:03:21,902
- Jimmie.

1591
02:03:21,969 --> 02:03:25,405
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1592
02:03:25,472 --> 02:03:28,909
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1593
02:03:30,377 --> 02:03:33,313
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

1594
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:35,949
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1595
02:03:38,018 --> 02:03:41,455
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1596
02:03:41,522 --> 02:03:44,958
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?

1597
02:03:45,025 --> 02:03:48,462
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive?

1598
02:03:48,529 --> 02:03:51,965
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1599
02:03:52,032 --> 02:03:56,103
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1600
02:03:56,170 --> 02:03:58,205
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

1601
02:04:03,844 --> 02:04:06,780
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1602
02:04:14,621 --> 02:04:16,757
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1603
02:04:16,823 --> 02:04:19,760
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1604
02:04:19,826 --> 02:04:22,563
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1605
02:04:22,629 --> 02:04:26,567
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1606
02:04:26,633 --> 02:04:30,070
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1607
02:04:30,137 --> 02:04:34,174
and clean the inside of the car...
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1608
02:04:34,241 --> 02:04:38,178
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1609
02:04:38,245 --> 02:04:41,181
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1610
02:04:41,248 --> 02:04:44,184
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1611
02:04:44,251 --> 02:04:48,622
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1612
02:04:48,689 --> 02:04:52,793
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1613
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:55,295
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1614
02:04:55,362 --> 02:04:58,298
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1615
02:04:58,365 --> 02:05:02,002
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1616
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:07,374
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1617
02:05:07,441 --> 02:05:09,376
with quilts and blankets,

1618
02:05:09,443 --> 02:05:13,380
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1619
02:05:13,447 --> 02:05:16,316
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1620
02:05:16,383 --> 02:05:18,452
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1621
02:05:18,519 --> 02:05:20,287
"Please" would be nice.

1622
02:05:21,755 --> 02:05:24,691
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1623
02:05:26,593 --> 02:05:30,430
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1624
02:05:32,232 --> 02:05:35,169
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1625
02:05:35,235 --> 02:05:37,671
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1626
02:05:37,738 --> 02:05:41,642
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1627
02:05:41,708 --> 02:05:45,045
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1628
02:05:45,112 --> 02:05:48,048
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1629
02:05:48,115 --> 02:05:50,918
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1630
02:05:50,984 --> 02:05:54,054
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1631
02:05:54,121 --> 02:05:58,759
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1632
02:05:58,825 --> 02:06:02,262
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1633
02:06:06,767 --> 02:06:10,437
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1634
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:15,843
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1635
02:06:17,911 --> 02:06:19,847
Green.

1636
02:06:21,448 --> 02:06:24,384
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1637
02:06:26,587 --> 02:06:29,022
About 20 minutes.

1638
02:06:30,524 --> 02:06:32,459
Nobody who'll be missed.

1639
02:06:34,528 --> 02:06:37,464
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1640
02:06:38,565 --> 02:06:40,501
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1641
02:06:40,567 --> 02:06:43,737
- I got it all here, but, uh,

1642
02:06:43,804 --> 02:06:47,241
- Mr. Wolf,
you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1643
02:06:47,307 --> 02:06:50,844
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1644
02:06:50,911 --> 02:06:52,846
Uh... Uh, no,
thank you.

1645
02:06:52,913 --> 02:06:56,049
Uh, this is
our best linen here,

1646
02:06:56,116 --> 02:06:59,052
and it's, uh...
it was a wedding present...

1647
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:01,555
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1648
02:07:01,622 --> 02:07:06,059
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help...
- Let me ask you a question.

1649
02:07:06,126 --> 02:07:09,062
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1650
02:07:10,631 --> 02:07:15,536
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1651
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:18,605
No.

1652
02:07:18,672 --> 02:07:21,108
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1653
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:24,645
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1654
02:07:24,711 --> 02:07:27,147
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1655
02:07:27,214 --> 02:07:31,485
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1656
02:07:31,552 --> 02:07:34,688
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1657
02:07:38,659 --> 02:07:42,596
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1658
02:07:43,730 --> 02:07:45,666
How about you, Jimmie?

1659
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,836
You an oak man?

1660
02:07:49,937 --> 02:07:51,872
Oak's nice.

1661
02:07:57,711 --> 02:08:01,582
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1662
02:08:01,648 --> 02:08:04,084
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1663
02:08:04,151 --> 02:08:07,588
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1664
02:08:07,654 --> 02:08:10,591
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1665
02:08:10,657 --> 02:08:13,594
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1666
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:16,530
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1667
02:08:16,597 --> 02:08:20,367
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1668
02:08:20,434 --> 02:08:24,037
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1669
02:08:24,104 --> 02:08:27,541
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1670
02:08:27,608 --> 02:08:29,543
That's all.
I could blow.

1671
02:08:29,610 --> 02:08:31,545
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1672
02:08:31,612 --> 02:08:34,548
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1673
02:08:34,615 --> 02:08:37,551
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1674
02:08:37,618 --> 02:08:39,553
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1675
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:42,556
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1676
02:08:42,623 --> 02:08:45,859
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1677
02:08:45,926 --> 02:08:48,362
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1678
02:08:58,138 --> 02:09:00,073
Fine job, gentlemen.

1679
02:09:01,408 --> 02:09:03,844
You may get out of this yet.

1680
02:09:03,911 --> 02:09:06,346
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1681
02:09:06,413 --> 02:09:09,850
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1682
02:09:09,917 --> 02:09:13,353
Phase one is complete... Clean the car...
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1683
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:15,355
Clean you two.

1684
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:18,792
Strip.

1685
02:09:18,859 --> 02:09:22,629
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1686
02:09:22,696 --> 02:09:25,799
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1687
02:09:25,866 --> 02:09:28,802
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1688
02:09:28,869 --> 02:09:31,371
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1689
02:09:31,438 --> 02:09:33,407
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1690
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:35,843
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1691
02:09:35,909 --> 02:09:39,346
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1692
02:09:39,413 --> 02:09:42,783
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1693
02:09:47,087 --> 02:09:49,556
Toss'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1694
02:09:49,623 --> 02:09:54,061
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1695
02:09:54,127 --> 02:09:58,365
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1696
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:01,735
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1697
02:10:01,802 --> 02:10:05,305
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1698
02:10:05,372 --> 02:10:08,308
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1699
02:10:08,375 --> 02:10:11,612
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1700
02:10:11,678 --> 02:10:14,615
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1701
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:17,551
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1702
02:10:17,618 --> 02:10:20,521
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!

1703
02:10:21,588 --> 02:10:23,524
Towel.

1704
02:10:34,034 --> 02:10:37,204
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1705
02:10:37,271 --> 02:10:40,541
Perfect.

1706
02:10:40,607 --> 02:10:44,077
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1707
02:10:44,144 --> 02:10:46,079
You guys look like...

1708
02:10:46,146 --> 02:10:48,582
What do they look like,
Jimmie?

1709
02:10:48,649 --> 02:10:52,252
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.

1710
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:55,822
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

1711
02:10:55,889 --> 02:10:58,625
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

1712
02:10:58,692 --> 02:11:00,627
Don't make me beg.

1713
02:11:03,697 --> 02:11:07,134
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1714
02:11:07,201 --> 02:11:10,771
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1715
02:11:10,838 --> 02:11:13,774
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1716
02:11:13,841 --> 02:11:15,742
The place is North Hollywood,

1717
02:11:15,809 --> 02:11:19,813
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1718
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,217
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1719
02:11:24,618 --> 02:11:26,553
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1720
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:30,557
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1721
02:11:30,624 --> 02:11:33,727
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
- Right.

1722
02:11:33,794 --> 02:11:36,730
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1723
02:11:36,797 --> 02:11:39,066
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1724
02:11:39,132 --> 02:11:41,568
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1725
02:11:41,635 --> 02:11:45,072
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

1726
02:11:45,138 --> 02:11:49,243
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1727
02:11:49,309 --> 02:11:52,246
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1728
02:11:52,312 --> 02:11:54,815
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1729
02:11:54,882 --> 02:11:57,818
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1730
02:12:01,655 --> 02:12:03,357
Outta my way, Rex.

1731
02:12:04,925 --> 02:12:07,361
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1732
02:12:07,427 --> 02:12:11,198
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1733
02:12:11,265 --> 02:12:13,901
Someday all this will be hers.

1734
02:12:13,967 --> 02:12:16,837
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

1735
02:12:16,904 --> 02:12:20,340
- You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

1736
02:12:20,407 --> 02:12:22,843
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1737
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:25,679
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1738
02:12:25,746 --> 02:12:27,114
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1739
02:12:27,181 --> 02:12:30,617
It's...
It's your future. I...

1740
02:12:30,684 --> 02:12:33,453
I see a...
a cab ride.

1741
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:36,490
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1742
02:12:36,557 --> 02:12:39,493
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1743
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,995
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1744
02:12:42,062 --> 02:12:45,999
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1745
02:12:46,066 --> 02:12:49,002
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1746
02:12:49,069 --> 02:12:51,004
Call me Winston.

1747
02:12:52,573 --> 02:12:55,509
- You see that, young lady? Respect.

1748
02:12:55,576 --> 02:12:59,780
- Respect for one's elders
shows character.
- I have character.

1749
02:12:59,847 --> 02:13:03,884
- Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.

1750
02:13:10,457 --> 02:13:13,393
- Wanna share a cab?

1751
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:17,731
- I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1752
02:13:17,798 --> 02:13:20,601
Cool.

1753
02:13:24,638 --> 02:13:27,741
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1754
02:13:27,808 --> 02:13:31,245
- Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

1755
02:13:31,311 --> 02:13:33,747
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1756
02:13:33,814 --> 02:13:36,250
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1757
02:13:36,316 --> 02:13:40,387
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1758
02:13:40,454 --> 02:13:43,056
- Want some bacon?

1759
02:13:43,123 --> 02:13:45,058
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1760
02:13:45,125 --> 02:13:48,562
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

1761
02:13:48,629 --> 02:13:51,565
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1762
02:13:51,632 --> 02:13:53,567
I don't eat filthy animals.

1763
02:13:53,634 --> 02:13:57,070
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1764
02:13:57,137 --> 02:14:00,073
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1765
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:03,076
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1766
02:14:03,143 --> 02:14:06,079
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1767
02:14:06,146 --> 02:14:10,083
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1768
02:14:10,150 --> 02:14:14,488
- What about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

1769
02:14:14,555 --> 02:14:17,891
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1770
02:14:17,958 --> 02:14:20,894
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1771
02:14:20,961 --> 02:14:22,896
but they're definitely dirty.

1772
02:14:22,963 --> 02:14:27,100
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,

1773
02:14:27,167 --> 02:14:30,737
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1774
02:14:30,804 --> 02:14:34,741
- Is that true?
- We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1775
02:14:34,808 --> 02:14:38,846
I mean, he'd have to be
ten times more charming than
that Arnold on Green Acres.

1776
02:14:44,451 --> 02:14:46,587
Oh, man, that's good.

1777
02:14:46,653 --> 02:14:50,257
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1778
02:14:50,324 --> 02:14:53,327
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1779
02:14:53,393 --> 02:14:55,829
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1780
02:14:55,896 --> 02:14:58,832
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1781
02:14:58,899 --> 02:15:02,169
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

1782
02:15:04,071 --> 02:15:07,274
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1783
02:15:10,744 --> 02:15:14,581
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1784
02:15:15,616 --> 02:15:17,551
But this morning...

1785
02:15:17,618 --> 02:15:20,354
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1786
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:24,124
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1787
02:15:24,191 --> 02:15:29,129
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi,
found my car keys.

1788
02:15:29,196 --> 02:15:32,199
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1789
02:15:32,266 --> 02:15:34,701
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1790
02:15:34,768 --> 02:15:37,938
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1791
02:15:38,005 --> 02:15:41,775
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1792
02:15:41,842 --> 02:15:43,777
God got involved.

1793
02:15:43,844 --> 02:15:45,579
But why?

1794
02:15:45,646 --> 02:15:48,682
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1795
02:15:48,749 --> 02:15:51,718
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1796
02:15:51,785 --> 02:15:53,720
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1797
02:15:53,787 --> 02:15:56,456
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1798
02:15:56,523 --> 02:15:59,893
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1799
02:16:01,195 --> 02:16:05,432
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1800
02:16:05,499 --> 02:16:09,102
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1801
02:16:09,169 --> 02:16:12,272
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1802
02:16:12,339 --> 02:16:15,776
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1803
02:16:15,843 --> 02:16:18,812
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1804
02:16:18,879 --> 02:16:21,148
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1805
02:16:21,215 --> 02:16:24,518
- 'Til God puts me
where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

1806
02:16:24,585 --> 02:16:29,523
- If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1807
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:33,260
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1808
02:16:33,327 --> 02:16:35,295
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1809
02:16:35,362 --> 02:16:38,665
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1810
02:16:38,732 --> 02:16:41,668
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1811
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:44,705
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1812
02:16:44,771 --> 02:16:48,442
And without a job,
a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.

1813
02:16:48,509 --> 02:16:50,444
You're gonna be
a fuckin' bum.

1814
02:16:50,511 --> 02:16:53,447
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1815
02:16:53,514 --> 02:16:56,350
Garçon! Coffee!

1816
02:16:56,416 --> 02:17:00,921
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1817
02:17:00,988 --> 02:17:04,124
- But water into wine, l...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1818
02:17:04,191 --> 02:17:07,294
- Don't fuckin' talk
to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,

1819
02:17:07,361 --> 02:17:09,963
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1820
02:17:12,833 --> 02:17:14,768
I'm gonna take a shit.

1821
02:17:17,638 --> 02:17:21,375
Let me ask you something.

1822
02:17:21,508 --> 02:17:23,644
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there
eatin' that muffin?

1823
02:17:23,710 --> 02:17:27,648
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1824
02:17:27,714 --> 02:17:29,650
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1825
02:17:29,716 --> 02:17:33,520
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1826
02:17:33,587 --> 02:17:36,723
Fuck. To be continued.

1827
02:17:48,735 --> 02:17:51,672
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1828
02:17:53,273 --> 02:17:56,210
- Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

1829
02:17:56,276 --> 02:18:01,281
Any one of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1830
02:18:01,348 --> 02:18:04,751
- You got that?
You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!

1831
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:07,888
Get on the fuckin'...
Get the fuck down!

1832
02:18:07,955 --> 02:18:12,693
You're in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth,
on the count of ten!

1833
02:18:12,759 --> 02:18:17,331
- Mexicans, out of
the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1834
02:18:17,397 --> 02:18:20,501
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1835
02:18:20,567 --> 02:18:23,036
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1836
02:18:23,103 --> 02:18:25,606
- Fucking move! Move!

1837
02:18:25,672 --> 02:18:27,941
- Move! Get the fuck...

1838
02:18:28,008 --> 02:18:31,044
Get down on the fucking floor!

1839
02:18:31,111 --> 02:18:33,046
Grandpa! Down!

1840
02:18:33,113 --> 02:18:36,483
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1841
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:39,486
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1842
02:18:39,553 --> 02:18:43,590
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1843
02:18:43,657 --> 02:18:48,362
- I think we got
a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1844
02:18:48,428 --> 02:18:50,364
- I am not a hero.

1845
02:18:50,430 --> 02:18:53,467
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1846
02:18:53,534 --> 02:18:55,302
The restaurant's ours!

1847
02:18:55,369 --> 02:18:58,305
- Just take whatever you want.

1848
02:18:58,372 --> 02:19:00,307
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1849
02:19:00,374 --> 02:19:03,510
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1850
02:19:03,577 --> 02:19:05,546
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1851
02:19:07,848 --> 02:19:09,650
Listen, everybody.

1852
02:19:09,716 --> 02:19:11,752
Be calm, cooperate,

1853
02:19:11,818 --> 02:19:14,755
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1854
02:19:14,821 --> 02:19:16,790
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1855
02:19:29,136 --> 02:19:32,573
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1856
02:19:32,639 --> 02:19:36,109
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1857
02:19:36,176 --> 02:19:38,412
I said, are we fucking clear?

1858
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:41,415
Good!
Now, wallets out!

1859
02:19:41,481 --> 02:19:45,085
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1860
02:19:45,152 --> 02:19:48,088
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't
have nothin' on me, man.

1861
02:19:48,155 --> 02:19:50,023
In the bag.

1862
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:53,026
What am I waiting for?
ln the fucking bag.

1863
02:19:53,093 --> 02:19:56,029
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1864
02:19:56,096 --> 02:19:58,332
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1865
02:19:58,398 --> 02:20:00,334
In the fucking bag.

1866
02:20:01,902 --> 02:20:05,372
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1867
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:07,875
In the bag.
In the bag.

1868
02:20:20,053 --> 02:20:21,989
In the bag.

1869
02:20:37,104 --> 02:20:40,040
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1870
02:20:40,107 --> 02:20:42,643
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1871
02:20:42,709 --> 02:20:45,412
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1872
02:20:45,479 --> 02:20:48,415
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1873
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:52,819
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1874
02:20:53,887 --> 02:20:56,223
What's going on?

1875
02:20:56,290 --> 02:20:59,760
- Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!

1876
02:20:59,826 --> 02:21:03,564
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

1877
02:21:03,630 --> 02:21:07,034
- If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems!

1878
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:09,903
You'll get us all killed! Give'em
what you got and get'em outta here!

1879
02:21:09,970 --> 02:21:14,208
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

1880
02:21:14,274 --> 02:21:16,510
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1881
02:21:16,577 --> 02:21:18,679
No problem.
I got it under control.

1882
02:21:20,247 --> 02:21:22,249
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1883
02:21:23,851 --> 02:21:27,788
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1884
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:34,127
We clear?

1885
02:21:37,264 --> 02:21:39,199
One.

1886
02:21:41,034 --> 02:21:43,570
Two.

1887
02:21:43,637 --> 02:21:45,706
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1888
02:21:45,772 --> 02:21:47,841
You win.

1889
02:21:47,908 --> 02:21:49,843
It's yours.

1890
02:21:53,881 --> 02:21:56,617
- Open it.

1891
02:22:00,487 --> 02:22:02,723
Hey, what is it?

1892
02:22:02,789 --> 02:22:05,125
What is it?

1893
02:22:05,192 --> 02:22:07,794
Is that what I think it is?

1894
02:22:12,132 --> 02:22:14,268
It's beautiful.

1895
02:22:14,334 --> 02:22:16,904
Goddamn it, what is it?

1896
02:22:18,372 --> 02:22:21,308
You let him go!
You let him go!

1897
02:22:21,375 --> 02:22:24,344
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1898
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:27,347
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool! Be cool!

1899
02:22:27,414 --> 02:22:30,150
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1900
02:22:30,217 --> 02:22:33,120
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1901
02:22:33,187 --> 02:22:34,988
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1902
02:22:35,055 --> 02:22:37,991
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1903
02:22:38,058 --> 02:22:39,960
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1904
02:22:40,027 --> 02:22:41,962
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1905
02:22:42,029 --> 02:22:45,465
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1906
02:22:45,532 --> 02:22:48,468
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1907
02:22:48,535 --> 02:22:52,039
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1908
02:22:52,105 --> 02:22:55,776
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1909
02:22:55,843 --> 02:22:57,778
- What?
- Cool.

1910
02:22:57,845 --> 02:23:00,681
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1911
02:23:00,747 --> 02:23:02,683
We're gonna be cool.

1912
02:23:02,749 --> 02:23:07,654
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1913
02:23:07,721 --> 02:23:09,823
And when I count three,

1914
02:23:09,890 --> 02:23:12,826
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1915
02:23:12,893 --> 02:23:16,363
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1916
02:23:17,431 --> 02:23:19,499
And when you do it,

1917
02:23:19,566 --> 02:23:21,635
you do it cool.

1918
02:23:21,702 --> 02:23:24,037
You ready?

1919
02:23:24,104 --> 02:23:26,206
One,

1920
02:23:26,273 --> 02:23:28,475
two,

1921
02:23:28,542 --> 02:23:30,477
three.

1922
02:23:37,451 --> 02:23:40,587
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1923
02:23:40,654 --> 02:23:44,258
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

1924
02:23:44,324 --> 02:23:46,426
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1925
02:23:46,493 --> 02:23:50,330
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

1926
02:23:51,965 --> 02:23:55,602
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1927
02:23:55,669 --> 02:23:59,072
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1928
02:23:59,139 --> 02:24:01,074
But I don't want that.

1929
02:24:01,141 --> 02:24:03,076
And you don't want that.

1930
02:24:03,143 --> 02:24:05,879
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1931
02:24:05,946 --> 02:24:08,048
So let's see what we can do.

1932
02:24:10,450 --> 02:24:13,687
Now... here's the situation.

1933
02:24:13,754 --> 02:24:17,624
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1934
02:24:17,691 --> 02:24:21,128
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1935
02:24:21,195 --> 02:24:24,131
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1936
02:24:24,198 --> 02:24:28,135
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1937
02:24:28,202 --> 02:24:31,138
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1938
02:24:31,205 --> 02:24:34,141
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1939
02:24:34,208 --> 02:24:36,076
- Vincent!

1940
02:24:36,143 --> 02:24:39,079
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1941
02:24:39,146 --> 02:24:41,849
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1942
02:24:41,915 --> 02:24:46,086
- Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.

1943
02:24:46,153 --> 02:24:48,222
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1944
02:24:48,288 --> 02:24:50,224
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

1945
02:24:50,290 --> 02:24:52,226
Tell her it's still cool.

1946
02:24:52,292 --> 02:24:55,229
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1947
02:24:56,630 --> 02:24:59,299
I... I gotta go pee.

1948
02:24:59,366 --> 02:25:01,301
I wanna go home.

1949
02:25:01,368 --> 02:25:04,972
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1950
02:25:05,038 --> 02:25:07,975
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1951
02:25:08,041 --> 02:25:11,411
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1952
02:25:11,478 --> 02:25:14,648
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

1953
02:25:14,715 --> 02:25:18,652
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1954
02:25:21,188 --> 02:25:25,125
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

1955
02:25:39,406 --> 02:25:41,942
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1956
02:25:42,042 --> 02:25:45,112
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1957
02:25:50,184 --> 02:25:52,319
Count it.

1958
02:25:58,659 --> 02:26:01,161
How much is there?

1959
02:26:03,096 --> 02:26:05,032
About 1,500 dollars.

1960
02:26:05,098 --> 02:26:08,268
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1961
02:26:08,368 --> 02:26:11,538
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

1962
02:26:11,638 --> 02:26:13,707
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1963
02:26:13,807 --> 02:26:17,711
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

1964
02:26:17,778 --> 02:26:21,215
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

1965
02:26:21,281 --> 02:26:23,350
Vince, shut the fuck up!

1966
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:27,321
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1967
02:26:27,387 --> 02:26:30,324
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

1968
02:26:30,390 --> 02:26:32,326
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1969
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:36,730
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

1970
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:41,535
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1971
02:26:41,635 --> 02:26:44,304
You read the Bible, Ringo?

1972
02:26:45,405 --> 02:26:47,341
Not regularly, no.

1973
02:26:47,407 --> 02:26:49,843
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1974
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:53,413
Ezekiel 25:17.

1975
02:26:53,514 --> 02:26:56,350
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1976
02:26:56,416 --> 02:26:58,352
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1977
02:26:58,418 --> 02:27:00,354
and the tyranny of evil men.

1978
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:03,790
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

1979
02:27:03,857 --> 02:27:06,293
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1980
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:10,430
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

1981
02:27:10,531 --> 02:27:14,801
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

1982
02:27:14,902 --> 02:27:17,938
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1983
02:27:18,038 --> 02:27:21,041
And you will know
I am the Lord...

1984
02:27:21,141 --> 02:27:24,678
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

1985
02:27:25,779 --> 02:27:28,215
I been sayin' that shit for years,

1986
02:27:28,282 --> 02:27:31,418
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

1987
02:27:31,518 --> 02:27:34,454
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

1988
02:27:34,521 --> 02:27:37,457
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

1989
02:27:37,524 --> 02:27:39,960
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

1990
02:27:40,027 --> 02:27:43,463
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

1991
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:46,466
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

1992
02:27:46,533 --> 02:27:51,405
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

1993
02:27:51,471 --> 02:27:54,408
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

1994
02:27:54,474 --> 02:27:58,011
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

1995
02:27:58,111 --> 02:28:00,047
Or it could mean...

1996
02:28:00,113 --> 02:28:03,550
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

1997
02:28:03,617 --> 02:28:07,554
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

1998
02:28:07,621 --> 02:28:09,857
Now, I'd like that.

1999
02:28:09,957 --> 02:28:12,860
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2000
02:28:12,926 --> 02:28:14,761
The truth is,

2001
02:28:15,863 --> 02:28:17,798
you're the weak...

2002
02:28:19,199 --> 02:28:22,603
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2003
02:28:24,004 --> 02:28:25,939
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2004
02:28:27,207 --> 02:28:30,143
I'm tryin' real hard...

2005
02:28:30,210 --> 02:28:32,446
to be the shepherd.

2006
02:28:47,794 --> 02:28:49,730
Go.

2007
02:29:07,414 --> 02:29:09,850
I think we should be
leaving now.

2008
02:29:09,917 --> 02:29:12,853
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
